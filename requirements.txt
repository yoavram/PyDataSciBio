# you can add libraries you want to install here - this is an example
# of a python library (moment) that I didn't find as part of nixos 
# pkgs. Sometimes they exist in both - you could keep it more 
# pythonic and use the requirements.txt (vs what I have done 
# above with xlswriter, pandas etc.)
